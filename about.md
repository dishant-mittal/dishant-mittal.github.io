<p>As part of big-data team (Connected Services) in Johnson Controls I have developed several map-reduce jobs (for problems like computing device run hours, finding hourly energy consumption statistics) to process Terabytes of data emitted from chillers (huge machines which regulate the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning in buildings). Also, I have collaborated with the team at Milwaukee to create a subset of the back-end of Johnson Controls' flagship product called Metasys. In 2016, I won the runner's up award at Johnson Control's technical fest for prototyping an idea which aimed at predicting faults in chiller operation, this consequently led to filing a US patent application (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/btoSNNjzXyCrjLyA3">Gallery</a>)</p>

<p>I have done several independent projects in the area of big-data and machine learning
 (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/btoSNNjzXyCrjLyA3">explore</a>). My skills span advanced machine learning and algorithms.</p>
