<p>As part of big-data team (Connected Services) in Johnson Controls I have developed several map-reduce jobs (for
 problems like computing device run hours, finding hourly energy consumption statistics) to process Terabytes of data
 emitted from chillers (huge machines which regulate the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning in buildings). Also, I have
 collaborated with the team at Milwaukee to create a subset of the back-end of Johnson Controls' flagship product called Metasys.</p>

<p>I have done several independent projects in the area of big-data and machine learning
 (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/btoSNNjzXyCrjLyA3">explore</a></p>). Computer Scientist and a full stack software
 developer experienced with advanced machine learning, algorithms and natural language processing.
 I love incorporating artificial intelligence algorithms into full stack software
 development. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/btoSNNjzXyCrjLyA3">link to gallery</a></p>
